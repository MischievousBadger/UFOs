# UFOs

## Overview/Purpose of the Analysis
Dana is a reporter who is interested in creating a website with information on UFO sightings throughout the world over a period of time.  She would like this to be interactive so viewers can filter the data easily by certain criteria, such as date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.  The purpose of the analysis is to create the interactive website for Dana while allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
To filter the UFO data on the webpage, one can type the filter criteria into the Filter Search along the left side of the webpage.  One filter at a time can be used, or to further narrow down results, multiple filters may be chosen.

For example, to search for UFO sightings in North Carolina, one would enter "nc" into the "Enter a State" filter box, and then press Enter on the keyboard.  Search results will return as follows:

As an example of multiple filters being chosen, the image below shows results from the city of El Cajon, ih the state of California, on a specific date (1/1/2010) of a triangle shape.

## Summary
The filter on the webpage does work; however, filter criteria must be entered very specifically and will only match the exact capitalization or spelling of the data being filtered.  This means that if "NC" or "North Carolina" is entered instead of "nc" while searching by the state, no results will be returned.  It is recommended that the filters be updated or "loosened" somewhat to allow for capitalization of entered data for city, state, country and shape, as well as allowing for the full names of states/countries.  Alternatively, instructions could be added to the web page to specify exactly how search criteria should be entered (date format, spelling/capitalization, etc.).  The data could also be cleaned/reformatted to capitalize states/countries/cities as these are most often in a propercase format.
